> **AdminCrack** is an open-source penetration testing utility designed to simulate password harvesting and bruteforcing techniques against a fake `sudo` clone ‚Äî all in a controlled, educational environment.

 <h1>About</h1>

AdminCrack is a lightweight and stealthy post-exploitation tool designed for red teams, ethical hackers, and security researchers to safely perform sudo bruteforcing without touching the real system binary.

Instead of hammering the actual /usr/bin/sudo ‚Äî which could trigger detection, logging, or rate-limiting mechanisms ‚Äî AdminCrack clones the sudo interface into a custom sandboxed wrapper, allowing you to:

Safely capture sudo prompts in a simulated environment

Bruteforce the fake sudo using custom or standard password lists (like rockyou.txt)

Avoid leaving traces in system logs or alerting EDR/HIDS tools

Validate if a guessed password is the real admin password by comparing against sudo behavior

Seamlessly escalate from low-privilege (guest) to high-privilege (admin) once the password is cracked

Great for lab environments, internal tests, or post-shell privilege escalation scenarios

With built-in detection to prevent accidentally targeting the real sudo, AdminCrack ensures safe testing conditions.
