> **AdminCrack** is an open-source penetration testing utility designed to simulate password harvesting and bruteforcing techniques against a fake `sudo` clone ‚Äî all in a controlled, educational environment.

---

## Description

**AdminCrack** helps security researchers and ethical hackers demonstrate the risks of password reuse and local privilege escalation by replacing `sudo` with a controlled, instrumented clone.\
It logs fake credentials and allows brute-forcing using a custom or existing wordlist (like `rockyou.txt`) to simulate cracking behavior.

### 3. Set up the fake sudo clone

chmod +x ~/bin/sudo
```

### 4. Add fake sudo to your path

Edit your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc` file and add:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
```

Then reload your shell config:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc   # or
source ~/.bashrc
```

## üß™ Usage Examples

### Run the brute-force engine

```bash
python3 cracker.py

```

You can replace this with any custom list.
